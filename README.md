# LibeliumIDE

For this project, me and my team used a Libelium Smart Environment Pro station and measured various room readings, like:
->Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) 
->Nitric Dioxide (NO2)
->Temperature, Humidity and Pressure
->Ozone (O3)
->Carbon Dioxide (CO2)

For this to be possible, I used a Waspmote IDE code and sent the data through a broker.
